<h3>The Insight of Data Visualization meets the Power of Interactivity...</h3>
<b>Vizupedia.org</b> {<i>project-Consilience</i>}, is an Encylopedia that embodies human knowledge in its <i>true nature</i>: an interconnected, nonlinear and decentralized network.
<b>Unlock perspective through iconography</b>; dissect the fractured branching of various subject matters by browsing the network and clicking to either reveal a node's sub-topics or show connections with other related subjects. 
<ul>
<li><i><b>Explore</b></i> endless levels in the hierarchy of disciplines while maintaining a synoptic overview of the whole network of knowledge</li>

<li><i><b>Search</b></i> in Vizupedia for any specific topic you'd like to know more about, and watch as the network animates and unwraps to reveal the contextual location of your query.</li>

<li><i><b>View</b></i> any node's encyclopedic article and factual data at any time whether navigating through nodes or inquiring about an explicit subject. All nodes have the option to reveal detailed source information, so you can learn in confidence with the benefit of extending your research to external sites and organizations.</li> 

<li><i><b>Share</b></i> links directly to a node, connection, article, and more from any current stage of network exploration with support for all major sharing platforms.</li>
</ul>
